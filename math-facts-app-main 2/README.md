# math-facts-app numberNerds Facts
# This App...test your skills and get awesome math facts!
# Nerds will agree, theseare truly trivia.

### url:  https://elisadossett.github.io/math-facts-app/

### Instructions:
Click on "Got to Solve'em All!" button in the nav. Solve a math expression. A correct answer gives you a super-charged Number trivia fact...Intrigued, I know!. Play as many times as you want! Click on close when you give up.
Leader Board worthy? the more you answer, the more you climb! (coming soon!)

This App is functional. Those who are crazy about numbers and math will like the quick interaction and almost endless random number trivial facts. The more you play the more trivial you get! There are additions coming soon.

# Present Functionality and requirements:
* SPA- Single Page Application

* Github Pages host - https://elisadossett.github.io/math-facts-app

* Github Respoitory on https://git.generalassemb.ly/elisadossett/math-facts-app & https://github.com/elisadossett/math-facts-app

* JavaScript to structure the code for SPA numberNerds App

* One HTTP request to a third-party server http://numbersapi.com/random/math

* Vanilla JS and jQuery for DOM manipulation

* Event listners and user imput

* Firebase is set up, 200 success upon running

* Best Practices used



### What will this App do?
This App is a fun interactive page to where the user will click on the "Got to Solve'em All!" button and a modal will pop up with a math expression or equation to be solved. If the answer is correct, a random math fact will be delivered. If incorrect, and alert will appear and you may try again or close. You can play as many times as you wish as long as you get the answer correct.


# Future tense of the App...

* The app will be designed to have a user sign in. The sign in will require a username and password. The username will be used for a Leaderboard.

* A learderboard with point values will be added. The user will accumulate points for correct answers and deduct points for incorrect tries.

* Instead of a limited number of expressions or equations, I hope to have another HTTP request for a math gernerator.

* The last item will be to host this App on a server and hold data.


# Technical Hurdles:

* The best math genorator I found for the my app was in Python. I wanted to use it and thought I could download it locally and run. That did not work. I asked and found you need to have backend code to support.

* Another hurdle, Setting up firebase as a server. The documentation will handle data, store and retrive it. Time was a factor here. I hope to use this server in the future with the app.

* Personal technical hurdles in the javaScript were the variables. When to use global variables and local variables. When the user clicks, answers questions and gets a HTTP response, the fuctions are using the same variables so knowing and using them properly was a challenge.

* A hurdle to overcome was making the math expressions only to display the question and not the answer until the user inputed their answer. It was a challenge to get the logic.

# New things I learned

* The importance of global variables vs. local variables

* Each API has their own documentation and the notation for pulling and dispalying data

* There are many moving parts to making a SPA
